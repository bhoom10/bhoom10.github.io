<p>Hi there! I'm Bhoomika Agarwal and I love coding, teaching, poetry, origami and reading books. I express my creative side through artwork, coding and origami. I put down my emotions by letting them flow out in the form of ink from my mind onto paper, forming poetry and blog posts on their way. As a programmer, I believe in the <a href="http://threevirtues.com/">three virtues</a> defined by Larry Wall:
<ol>
<li>Laziness</li> 
<li>Impatience</li>
<li>Hubris</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>My work is fueled by a combination of these three virtues, while the rest of my life is fueled by the principles set down in <a href="http://threevirtues.com/">The Zen of Python</a> by Tim Peters. In my opinion, it is the most beautiful poem ever that sets down design guidelines for code that can be extended to life. 
</p>

<p>Professionally, I'm currently pursuing Masters in the field of Computer Science - Data Science track in the domain of Educational technologies at TU Delft. 
Since a very young age, I have dreamed of working with technology that brings positive change and has a real-life impact on peopleâ€™s lives. This was my prime motivation for pursuing my studies in computer science and it continues to drive me till date. </p>

<p>This website has been created using <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">Hyde</a>. Credits to Jash Mehta for his super-simple tutorial on <a href="https://jashmehta3300.medium.com/how-to-make-a-blog-using-hyde-jekyll-and-host-it-on-github-pages-42123c239b8"><i>How to make a blog using Hyde (Jekyll) and host it on Github Pages</i></a> and to <a href="https://chrisschuld.com/">Chris Schuld</a> for inspiring some of the custom design of my personal website.</p>
