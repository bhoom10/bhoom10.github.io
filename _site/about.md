In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)

Hi there! I'm Bhoomika Agarwal and I love coding, teaching, poetry, origami and reading books. I express my creative side through artwork, coding and origami. I put down my emotions by letting them flow out in the form of ink from my mind onto paper, forming poetry and blog posts on their way. As a programmer, I believe in the [three virtues](http://threevirtues.com/) defined by Larry Wall:
1. Laziness 
2. Impatience
3. Hubris

My work is fueled by a combination of these three virtues, while the rest of my life is fueled by the principles set down in [The Zen of Python](http://threevirtues.com/) by Tim Peters. In my opinion, it is the most beautiful poem ever that sets down design guidelines for code that can be extended to life. 

Professionally, I'm currently pursuing Masters in the field of Computer Science - Data Science track in the domain of Educational technologies at TU Delft. 
Since a very young age, I have dreamed of working with technology that brings positive change and has a real-life impact on peopleâ€™s lives. This was my prime motivation for pursuing my studies in computer science and it continues to drive me till date. 

This website has been created using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde). Credits to Jash Mehta for his super-simple tutorial on [*How to make a blog using Hyde (Jekyll) and host it on Github Pages*](https://jashmehta3300.medium.com/how-to-make-a-blog-using-hyde-jekyll-and-host-it-on-github-pages-42123c239b8) and to [Chris Schuld](https://chrisschuld.com/) for inspiring some of the custom design of my personal website.
