<p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Bhoomika Agarwal and I love coding, teaching, poetry, origami and reading books. I express my creative side through artwork, coding and origami. I put down my emotions by letting them flow out in the form of ink from my mind onto paper, forming poetry and blog posts on their way. As a programmer, I believe in the <a href="http://threevirtues.com/">three virtues</a> defined by Larry Wall:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Laziness</li>
  <li>Impatience</li>
  <li>Hubris</li>
</ol>

<p>My work is fueled by a combination of these three virtues, while the rest of my life is fueled by the principles set down in <a href="http://threevirtues.com/">The Zen of Python</a> by Tim Peters. In my opinion, it is the most beautiful poem ever that sets down design guidelines for code that can be extended to life.</p>

<p>Professionally, Iâ€™m currently pursuing Masters in the field of Computer Science - Data Science track in the domain of Educational technologies at TU Delft. 
Since a very young age, I have dreamed of working with technology that brings positive change and has a real-life impact on peopleâ€™s lives. This was my prime motivation for pursuing my studies in computer science and it continues to drive me till date.</p>
