My love for computer science began in grade 8 when I attended my first class in a progamming course. I would like to thank my teachers then, who explained concepts time and again in a simple way, thereby laying a strong foundation. This love continued into my pre-university studies. Since I was a bit unsure about choosing between biology and computer science in pre-university, I decided to pursue both. Despite managing parallel classes in both, I passed them with flying colors and my love for computer science grew stronger. During my bachelors, I found an inspiring mentor in [*Dr. Snehanshu Saha*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snehanshusaha/), who was an excellent guide for most of my projects. He inspired me personally with his love for teaching and for computer science.

My Masters was a further step in this direction, bringing along new experiences in a foreign country. The high quality of education offered by TU Delft, with a focus on practical knowledge, made it all worth it. I have  only learnt a lot and also met some amazing people along the way. I'm currently pursuing my Master thesis in the domain of Educational technologies and am very excited about completing it by this summer. Following this, I would like to further move in the direction of teaching with a Ph.D. or a relevant teaching position.
