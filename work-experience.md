title: Work experience

My work experience was spread over 2 companies over a period of 3 years. At Sprinklr, I learnt the value of good quality of code through test automation. I decided to share my knowledge with the rest of the world through my online course on LinkedIn Learning. Owing to the startup culture, I also made some close friends there. At SAP, I understood the value of team work. I learnt that no matter how big a company is, people will not hesitate to help you out, provided you are willing to ask for help. When I was stuck at an issue, even colleagues in other teams were willing to help when I reached out to them. SAP provided me with opportunities and tools to explore and grow both technically and personally. 

In the Netherlands, I interned at SD-Insights to get my hands dirty with some real-world data. While we had learnt a lot of theory at college, I learnt the value of data cleaning and pre-processing here. It was an open environment where I received all the support to learn new technologies and experiment with the data. As a teaching assistant at TU Delft, I saw the courses that I studied from the teacher's point of view. I saw the challenges faced by them and tried to help them solve them.
