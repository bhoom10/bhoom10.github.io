Next time you want to ask someone if they are daring enough, I strongly suggest that you ask them-

>  ‘Do you have the vagina to do it?’

Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus. Agreed. Both are different and deserve to be treated with equal rights and opportunities. The question at hand is - *Are Women the Weaker sex?* I strongly disagree. Here’s why I think so…

------

Let’s look at some biology and examine facts at a basic level. Men produce more testosterone, which translates to their muscles developing better and their frames being stronger. However, women produce more estrogens, which keep their heart healthy and increase their longevity. Women have stronger resilience and a [higher pain sensitivity while men have a higher pain threshold](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677686/).

Let’s step back in time for a bit - way back in time to the hunter-gatherer societies. The myth is that the wife stayed at home and the husband brought back food and provided for the family. This has been refuted with research and evidence which shows that [women were known to hunt and raise children at the same time](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/science/05nean.html). Hunting- which is portrayed as a masculine activity- was known to be done by both men and women without any gender bias.

A recent [academic study](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/4/E832) by researchers at the University of South Denmark has shown that women have survived famines, enslavements and epidemics for longer than men. Study of the survival patterns of calamities such as the Irish famine of 1845–1849, the Iceland measles epidemics of 1846 and 1882, and the experiences of freed Liberian slaves returning to Africa from the US in the early 19th century support these claims. Women were seen to have lower mortality and live longer than men on an average.

While some might attribute this to an age factor, higher survival rate is seen in females right from birth. A million infants die on the very day of their birth each year. Given the same level of care, newborn boys have 10% greater risk than newborn girls. This higher survival rate continues across all ages in women. [Heart diseases are known to hit men earlier than women](https://www.verywellhealth.com/heart-disease-men-vs-women-4126017). Higher levels of estrogen and progesterone not only keep their immune systems stronger, but also more flexible.

[Women are known to be particularly good at endurance running](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-49284389). In modern day ultra-marathons, female runners are more likely to finish the route, proving more resilience both mentally and physically to the challenges of the race.

Besides having this physical advantage, women also have an edge when it comes to other aspects. Have you ever heard a woman ask the question- ‘What should I do now?’. The only place where I have seen this happen is in movies. Women are more headstrong and have an innate gut feeling that helps them make decisions. Most people who are looking for advice generally approach a woman. Women see opportunities in everything and seize those opportunities. They are known for their perseverance. Also, they are natural givers who are self-driven and motivated.

The Greek mythology portrayed their saviors as Amazons - the real *Wonder Women*- strong, brave and bold. The truth is, the modern-day women are also Amazons that have been hidden behind a gender bias. All we need to do is lift that curtain. So, the next time you want to challenge someone and question their will power, ask them - *‘Do you have the vagina to do it?’*

P.S: I am not a female chauvinist. I believe in gender equality and am only stating facts based on research. In this article, I’m trying to bring out what being a woman means to me — the aspect of strength and perseverance.

P. P. S. : This quote by Nnennaya Amuchie summarizes my take on feminism: *“I don’t want to be equal to men. Men are not the standard of humanity. I want to live on my own terms free from violence.”*
